# DISCLAMER!
This is an __UPDATED__, __UNOFFICIAL__ documentary of __Markdown__, created for _beginners_, some things might ___change___, it's all based by my ___knowledge___ about _MarkDown_ system.

# Chapter I: Text Formatting
The text formatting is to __mark__ words when you need to, here're some examples:
## Bold
```
__bold__ or **bold**
```
## Italic
```
_italic_ or *italic*
```
## Bold-italic
```
___bold-italic___ or ***bold-italic***
```
## Strike-through
```
~~strike-through~~
```
## Code blocks
```
Code blocks should have "```" at the start and at the end of a word, useful for scripts.
```
## Quotes
```
> quote
```

# Chapter II: Tables, Images and Links
Tables are used to make __statisitcs__ on whatever, into the page.

Images are used to __PIN__ the image onto the webpage.

Links are used to show links for more infomation for example.

`Note: This doesn't work in Ravbug's MarkdownViz, because apperently it doesn't support tables, strike-through text formatting and images.`

## Tables
The table is about the translation of numbers in 3 different languages, English, Spanish and Russian.
| English | Spanish | Russian |
| :--- | :--: | ---: |
| One | Uno | Один |
| Two | Dos | Два |
| Three | Tres | Три |
| Four | Cuatro | Четыре |
| Five | Cinco | Пять |

## Images
NOTICE: You need to __MANUALLY__ provide an image link to your document, or it'll ___NOT___ work.
It works like this
```
![IMAGE_TEXT](URLHERE)
```
## Links
Links are like __Images__ but you don't need to provide the exclamation mark ( ! ) and you mustn't manually provide an image link.
How it works
```
[TEXT](URLHERE)
```
Here're some few examples:
