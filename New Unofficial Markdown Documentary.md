# DISCLAMER!
This is an __UPDATED__, __UNOFFICIAL__ documentary of __Markdown__, created for _beginners_, some things might ___change___, it's all based by my ___knowledge___ about _MarkDown_ system. ```(With some help by DeepSeek)```


# Chapter I: Text Formatting
The text formatting is to __mark__ words when you need to, here're some examples:
## Bold
```
__bold__ or **bold**
```
## Italic
```
_italic_ or *italic*
```
## Bold-italic
```
___bold-italic___ or ***bold-italic***
```
## Strike-through
```
~~strike-through~~
```
## Code blocks
```
Code blocks should have "```" at the start and at the end of a word, useful for scripts.
```
## Blockquote
```
> blockquote
```

# Chapter II: Tables, Images and Links
Tables are used to make __statisitcs__ on whatever, into the page.

Images are used to __PIN__ the image onto the webpage.

Links are used to show links for more infomation for example.

`Note: This doesn't work in Ravbug's MarkdownViz, because apperently it doesn't support tables, strike-through text formatting, images, blockquotes and more. It does lack a LOT of functions.`

## Tables
The table is about the translation of numbers in 3 different languages, English, Spanish and Russian.
| English | Spanish | Russian |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| One | Uno | Один |
| Two | Dos | Два |
| Three | Tres | Три |
| Four | Cuatro | Четыре |
| Five | Cinco | Пять |

## Images
NOTICE: You need to __MANUALLY__ provide an image link to your document, or it'll ___NOT___ work.
It works like this
```
![IMAGE_TEXT](URLHERE)
```
## Links
Links are like __Images__ but you don't need to provide the exclamation mark ( ! ) and you mustn't manually provide an image link.
How it works
```
[TEXT](URLHERE)
```
Here're some few examples:

[Example Domain](example.org)

[Click on me, pls](www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsIa_LKojJI)

### You can also do reference links!
Note: Replace "NUM" with an actual number, "{LINK}" with an actual link.

```
[Reference][NUM]
[NUM]: {LINK} "LINKTITLE"
```

2. Game
3. Study
4. Repeat

## Task List

## Chapter IV: Escaping Characters, Footnotes and Extended Syntax (Math Formulas)

Escaping Characters can help with showing on what symbol should be to mark text.

Footnotes are helpful to make notes on some text.

Escaping Characters

```
\*This is not an italic text.\*
\#This is not a heading
\[This is not a link\]
```

Footnote

```
Footnote[^1]
[^1]: Content of a Footnote.
```

Math Formulas (Extended Syntax)
```
Inline formula: $E = mc^2$

Block formula:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 0
$$
```
## Chapter V: Escaping Characters List
```
